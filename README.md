My first GitHub repository
My name is Andrew Gurbaxani, and I live with my wife Sonia in Roswell, GA. We have been happily married for 25 years. I have a background in Electrical Engineering (BSEE Rice, MSEE Stanford) and Management (MBA MIT Sloan). I have worked for Benevis, a Dental Services Organization supporting the "Kool Smiles" brand, for the past 5 years.
